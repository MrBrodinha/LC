Problema A -> Convert the formula to only contain NORs.

Problema B -> Apply the DPLL algorithm to the formula and return UNSAT (unsatisfiable) or SAT (satisfiable).

The package "f_parser" (provided by the teacher) converts a string into a formula type. For example, the string "A -> B" would be converted to the formula representation "Implies(A, B)".
